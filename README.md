# The Typing of the Dead Phrase Listing

This is code for [generating the magical phrase listing from Typing of the Dead](http://jonathansoma.com/projects/typing-of-the-dead), an arcade/Dreamcast game where you type words and phrases instead of shooting zombies. It's amazing.

If you don't like how I did my processing, you can find the code to generate your own files in [process.sh](process.sh). Pull requests welcome.
